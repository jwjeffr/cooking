<meta name="description" content="Ingredients:


Chicken

Any cut works! This is a slow-cooked meal, so anything will be tender
This is the only ingredient that can&rsquo;t be vegan, so feel free to substitute this for something else to make it vegan! Just be sure that whatever substitute you have will survive in a slow cooker. Or, if won&rsquo;t survive, cook it separately!


Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce

My go-to&rsquo;s are this brand


Tomatoes in sauce

Canned San Marzano tomatoes are my go-to, or anything similar. I find that you can really taste the difference between high-quality and cheap tomatoes in this dish


White onion(s)

These will end up being diced, so feel free to buy them pre-diced.


Minced garlic

If you prefer the taste of fresh garlic, feel free to mince garlic yourself! Or buy it canned, no shame here :)


Mexican oregano

This one is a bit hard to find in my experience, so I usually just use an Italian seasoning blend instead. But, if you can find this, use it!


Fresh cilantro
Extra virgin olive oil
Ramen noodles

Any of your choice! I love the cheap packets.


Stock

Some sort of cooking stock. Chicken broth is the best option in my opinion. I usually just microwave water and stir around a chicken bouillon cube. You can also make a stock out of the seasoning packet that comes with your ramen noodles, but be careful to not use the whole packet - your dish will be very salty if you do.


MSG (Optional)

I put MSG, aka Make Shit Good, in pretty much every savory dish I make. You can leave this out if you want


Sliced avocado (Optional)

Good for garnishing. I&rsquo;m allergic to it, so I always leave it out


Jalapeno (Optional)

For garish


Red onion (Optional)

Also for garnish


Lime wedges (Optional)

Last garnish!



Instructions:



If your chicken has skin on it, remove it. Set it aside - you won&rsquo;t need it for this recipe. You can air fry them to make delicious chips!" />

<hr>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your chicken has skin on it, remove it. Set it aside - you won&rsquo;t need it for this recipe. You can air fry them to make delicious chips!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dice your white onion(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally saute the minced garlic and white onion. This does add some flavor, but not a whole lot relative to the chipotle peppers, so feel free to skip this step if you don&rsquo;t want to use another dish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your tomatoes, chicken, chipotle peppers, garlic, and onion in your slow cooker. Optionally break off your cilantro stems and put the stems in. The fibrous texture that a lot of people don&rsquo;t like becomes less chalky when they&rsquo;re slow-cooked, in my opinion. All of these amounts are to your heart&rsquo;s desire, but I usually use one 7-oz can of chipotle peppers per 3 chicken thighs. Just remember that the tomatoes and chipotle peppers should be the star of the show :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix the mixture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Season the mixture with MSG, oregano, and a little bit of olive oil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set aside, and cook on a low-heat for at least 4 hours. The longer this cooks, the better, but the acidity in the adobo sauce can give the chicken a weird texture if you cook it for way too long. This probably shouldn&rsquo;t be cooking for more than 8 hours. Halfway through cooking, or once the chicken is fork-tender, shred the chicken, and remove the bones if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right before the chicken is done cooking, cook your ramen noodles in your stock. You should ideally slightly undercook them, since they&rsquo;ll cook a bit in the chicken/sauce mixture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the chicken is done, shut off the slow cooker and thoroughly stir the chicken and sauce together. Let this cool down a little bit, at least until it stops boiling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the noodles in the pot, and add stock until the chicken/sauce mixture reaches a consistency you like. Remember, you can always add, but not remove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serve in bowls, putting your garnishes (avocado, jalapeno, red onion, and lime wedges) on top, and enjoy! This is best served with Corona Light beer, in my opinion :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
</li>
